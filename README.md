## The goal of the project

In this project we did as a group work, I gained experience especially for 'React'. In addition, I used other plugins such as NodeJs, NoSql in the project. The project is an e-commerce site. In the project, operations such as adding the product to the basket and purchasing can be done. Additionally, we created an Admin panel. You can make changes such as adding, updating and deleting products, and you can follow up orders.
